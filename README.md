# final-project
This is the github for the final project

For this project, we need to realize character recognition, real-time video stream image recognition and Android App related functions

First of all, you can see two pictures in the library. These two pictures are test samples for text recognition. The python file named picamera is used to call the camera function of raspberry pie

On the other hand, you can see the python file named text. This file is used for the implementation of the text recognition related functions. The specific implementation steps can be learned by viewing the FYP report.

Third, you can see a python file named video for description, which is mainly used to detect and identify the video stream, and the training data set of related calls can be found in the library.but by the way,we can't put the EAST on the git, because is too big for one file, it just for text recognize, and the way we should use I say in the  report, it doesn't metter

Fourth, you can see a compressed package called Java. The files in this package are mainly used for the implementation of Android App related functions.

Let's give an example.

For text recognition, you can view the code of text recognition, which contains all the codes executed by the project. After the installation of the relevant environment, you can find that for the code, you only need to CD it to the code location and set the picture to the same location. Then you can use the command set in the code To carry out relevant text recognition, you can also use padding to fill around the text box to change the accuracy of recognition
